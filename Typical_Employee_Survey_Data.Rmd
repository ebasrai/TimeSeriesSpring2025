##Typical_Employee_Survey_Data


### Change the Name to make it easier to work with

TESD = Typical_Employee_Survey_Data

##Add column headers for each column

colnames(TESD) = c("Age", "Gender", "Satisfaction", "Job Characteristics",
"Years worked", "promotion likely hood", "decision making", "budgetary decisions",
"proudness", "pay importance", "workplace relations")

##Do 5 number summary for the two numeric columns

fivenum(TESD$Age)
fivenum(TESD$`Years worked`)

##Create box plots for Numeric columns

boxplot(TESD$Age, main = "Age")

###The median of the data is around just under 40 years old. The data also looks relatively symmetric. There are a few outliers above 60 years old. 

boxplot(TESD$`Years worked`, main = "Years Worked")

###The data displays mos the date lies near and under the 10 year ranges. There are outliers over 30 years old. There is also a very small Q1 but large Q4.

##Make the non numeric columns into factors

TESD$Gender <- as.factor(TESD$Gender)
TESD$Satisfaction <- as.factor(TESD$Satisfaction)
TESD$`Job Characteristics` <- as.factor(TESD$`Job Characteristics`)
TESD$`promotion likely hood` <- as.factor(TESD$`promotion likely hood`)
TESD$`decision making` <- as.factor(TESD$`decision making`)
TESD$`budgetary decisions` <- as.factor(TESD$`budgetary decisions`)
TESD$proudness <- as.factor(TESD$proudness)
TESD$`pay importance` <- as.factor(TESD$`pay importance`)
TESD$`workplace relations` <- as.factor(TESD$`workplace relations`)

##Create histograms for numeric columns

###Age Plot

hist(TESD$Age, breaks = 10, main = "Age")

#### The median of the data appears to be around the age of 40 years old.
#### The data does appear to be normally distributed with a min of 20 and a high of 64.
####Overall the data displays a wide ranges of ages from 20-64 with most of the people being within 30-45.

###Years worked plot

hist(TESD$`Years worked`, breaks = 5, main = "Years worked")

###The histogram displays a skewed data set where most of the people have worked under 10 years.
###There is an outlier who has worked between 50 and 60 years. 
###As the amount of years worked increases the frequency decreases significantly.

##Creating barcharts for factors columns

###Gender plot

barplot(table(factor(TESD$Gender, 
levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("M", "F"))),
col = "blue", main = "gender distribution")

###This data is showing that there is a higher frequency of males than females. 
###The split is 70 males to 50 females. 

###Satisfaction rating

barplot(table(factor(TESD$Satisfaction, 
levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4), labels = c("Very Satisfied", "Moderately Satisfied",
"little dissatisfied", "Very dissatisfied"))),
col = "blue", main = "Job Satisfaction")

###The employees in general are either very or moderately satisfied with their job.
###With 109 employees total in the satisfaction category and 13 in the dissatisfied group
### it seems the company is doing well in an employee point of view. 

#### Job Characteristics

barplot(table(factor(TESD$`Job Characteristics`, 
levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4,5), labels = c("income", "security",
"Flexiblity", "Advance", "Enjoyment"))),
col = "blue", main = "Job Characteristcs")

###Based on the plot the 3 most important categories are income, advancement, and enjoyment.
###The two least important categories are secruity and flexibility. For the future of the business
###it would make sense to focus on improving the 3 more imporant catgeories to increase impact. 

###Promotion Likelihood

barplot(table(factor(TESD$`promotion likely hood`, 
levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4,5), labels = c("Vlikely", "Likely",
"Not sure", "Unlikely", "Vunlikley"))),
col = "blue", main = "Promotion Likely hood")

###The takeaway from this that there is about an equal amount of people who think they are unlikely 
###and likely to be promoted. The business should look into making employees feel they can be promoted.
###If people think they can be promoted then they will work harder. 

###Decision Making

barplot(table(factor(TESD$`decision making`, 
levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4), labels = c("Always", "Most",
"Some", "never"))),
col = "blue", main = "Factor in Decision Making")

###Most employees take part in decision making either most or some of the time. There is a very
###small count of employees who are never involved which is a good thing. 

###Budgetary Decisions

barplot(table(factor(TESD$`budgetary decisions`, 
levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Yes", "No"))), ylim = c(0,80),
col = "blue", main = "Budgetary Decisions")

###The amount of employees that particpate in budet decision is relatively even.
###With over 60 employees saying yes and under 60 saying no. Letting more employees 
###have input might give more value to the company. 

###Proudness Graph

barplot(table(factor(TESD$proudness, 
levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4), labels = c("Very", "Somewhat",
"indifferent", "Not"))),
col = "blue", main = "Proudness")

###The majority of employees are somewhat proud with some being very proud.
###On the other hand there are very few indifferent and not proud employees.  

###Pay importance

barplot(table(factor(TESD$`pay importance`, 
levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4,5), labels = c("Vlikely", "Likely",
"Not sure", "Unlikely", "Vunlikley"))), ylim = c(0,60),
col = "blue", main = "Pay Importance")

###The vast majority of the employees are opiniated on if they would leave or not.
###The bigger chunk of employees would not turn down the job for more money. 
###This does make sense where in the previous question income was an important charateristic.

###Workplace Relations

barplot(table(factor(TESD$`workplace relations`, 
levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4), labels = c("Very", "good",
"somewhat", "bad"))),ylim = c(0,80),
col = "blue", main = "Workplace Relations")

###The graph shows that most employees have good relations with others in the workplace.
###On top of that the second biggest group have a very good relation. 
###In summary most employees have good working relations with the exception of a few employees. 

##Scatter Plots

###Age Vs Yrs Worked

plot(TESD$Age, TESD$`Years worked`, main = "Age vs Years worked")

###There is a clear positive correlation with Age and years worked. 
###There appears to a major bunch that occurs between about the age of 40 and 10 years worked. 

###Age vs decision making

plot(TESD$Age,as.numeric(TESD$`decision making`), col = "blue", pch = 20, main = "Age vs decision making")

###The scatter plot does not show muhc of a correlation with age and decision making.
###Although slight there does seem to be a bit more decision making as the age increases. 


###Years worked vs promotion likelihood

plot(TESD$`Years worked`,as.numeric(TESD$`promotion likely hood`), col = "blue", pch = 20, main = "Years Worked vs Promotion")


###There is some positive correlation that can be seen with years worked and promotion likeliness.

#### It appears that the more years worked means they have more faith in a promotion

###Age vs job characteristics

plot(TESD$Age,as.numeric(TESD$`Job Characteristics`), col = "blue", pch = 20, main = "Job characteristics vs Age")

###There appears to be more importance on income for younger people. 
###There also appears to be a higher importance of job security for younger people as well. 
###There is more importance of advancements for older employees. 

###years worked vs workplace relation

plot(TESD$`Years worked`,as.numeric(TESD$`workplace relations`), col = "blue", pch = 20, main = "Years worked vs Workplace Relations")

###There is a strong correlation with younger employees having better workplace relations. 
###There is signs that older people have a bit worse of a workplace relations than others.
