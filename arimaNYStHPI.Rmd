### findings from the arima are that the timeseries are differentiated twice and uses 3 lagged terms. The 33.81 sigma is pretty low when looking at the data meaning the variance is not super high. 

future <- forecast(fit, h = 5)
plot(future, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Forecasted NY HPI", main = "ARIMA Forecast for NYSTHPI")

future



Acf(fit$residuals)
Box.test(residuals(fit), lag=20, type="Ljung")
plot.ts(residuals(fit))
hist(fit$residuals)
tsdiag(fit)


# Plot forecast
plot(future, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Forecasted NY HPI", main = "ARIMA Forecast for NYSTHPI")


accuracy(fit)


### The accuracy from the arima is 1.52 MAPE which is relatively decent. This means that the model is about 1.52% off in predicting the actrual value which is a good indicator for future values.
